# Architecture Decision Records

## ADR-001 — Build an Automation Engine, Not a General Image Editor
**Status:** Accepted

Project value is sticker-specific automation. Existing editors already solve general canvas/layer/manual-editing problems.

## ADR-002 — Do Not Fork Krita for MVP
**Status:** Accepted

Build an independent engine first to avoid upstream merge and maintenance complexity.

## ADR-003 — Deterministic Before AI
**Status:** Accepted

Use rule-based image processing whenever the problem can be solved reliably without AI.

## ADR-004 — Three Input Modes
**Status:** Accepted

`AUTO`, `TRANSPARENT`, `OPAQUE`.

## ADR-005 — Conservative Automation
**Status:** Accepted

If uncertain, return `REVIEW` rather than perform destructive correction.

## ADR-006 — Config-Driven Export Profiles
**Status:** Accepted

LINE-specific constraints must not be scattered through core source code.

## ADR-007 — 512×512 Is a Working Frame
**Status:** Accepted

The source production sheet may use 512×512 cells. Final upload assets are generated through an export profile.

## ADR-008 — Adaptive Border Removal Runs Per Frame After Split
**Status:** Accepted

Borders may differ by color, thickness and side. Detect/removal therefore occurs on each extracted frame using edge position, continuity, geometry and connectivity. Color-only deletion is prohibited as a general strategy. Ambiguous border/artwork contact becomes `REVIEW`.

## ADR-009 — Quality-Preserving Transform Policy
**Status:** Accepted

Use lossless-first processing, preserve alpha edge information, avoid repeated resizing, preserve aspect ratio and disable automatic upscaling by default. Prefer one final resize for target export.

## ADR-010 — Core Must Remain Headless and Krita-Optional
**Status:** Accepted

Krita is a manual-review/editor integration, not a mandatory runtime dependency of the core pipeline.

## ADR-011 — Windows Distribution Hides Developer Dependencies
**Status:** Accepted

Production Windows users should receive a standalone application/installer and must not be required to install Python/OpenCV/toolchains manually.
